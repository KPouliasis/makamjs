The Makam Metalanguage -- a tool for rapid language prototyping

Makam is a metalanguage that eases implementation of languages with rich type systems, supporting
concise and modular language definitions, aimed at allowing rapid prototyping and experimentation
with new programming language research ideas. The design of Makam is based on higher-order logic
programming and is a refinement of the Î»Prolog language. Makam is implemented from scratch in OCaml.

The name comes from the makam/maqam of traditional Turkish and Arabic music: a set of
techniques of improvisation, defining the pitches, patterns and development of a piece of music.
